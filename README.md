# tempotoets

A timed times table test - for kids and the resto of us.

Let's make the tempotoets fun again :)

The tempotoets is a test to see how many mental arithmetic questions you can answer in a short amount of time. It's fun and surprisingy tricky (even though the questions are straightforward). 

This is a challenging commandline quiz to train your brain on times tables from 2 through to 12. I bet you can't score more than 35 on a 60 second tempotoets!

Hints:

- ** requires python 3 and pickle **
- You can clear your high score list from the main menu by typing "clear high scores"
- Running "stats" from the main menu will generate a list of the trickiest questions to test your wits against
- You can change the length of the quiz (default 60 seconds) by specifying a number of seconrds when calling the script. For example, to run a tempotoets of 10 seconds, use: python tempo_toets.py 10 OR from the main menu by selecing option t.
- Each tempotoets length has its own high score list
- The more you practice, the quicker you get...
- Enjoy :)
