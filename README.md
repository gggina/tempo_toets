# tempo_toets
A timed times table test that makes the tempotoets fun again :)

This is a fun quiz to train your brain on times tables from 2 through to 12.

Hints:

- ** requires python 3 and pickle **
- You can clear your high score list from the main menu by typing "clear high scores")
- If you run "stats" from the main menu this will generate a list of the trickiest questions to test your wits against
- By default, the tempotoets lasts for 60 seconds. You can change the length of the quiz by specifying a number (in seconds) when calling the script. For example: python tempo_toets.py 10
